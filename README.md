# Colorschemes for the `colorer` engine.

This is a simple repository where all the colorschemes to be used with [colorer](https://github.com/kiddae/colorer) I have found are stored.

To use it with `colorer`, download the files to wherever you want (`~/.config/colorer/colorschemes/` for example) and then run `colorer <filepath>` accordingly. See the [repo](https://github.com/kiddae/colorer) and [my dotfiles](https://github.com/kiddae/dotfiles) for more information.

The wallpapers set in these colorscheme files can be found on my (messy) [wallpaper repo](https://github.com/kiddae/wallpapers).
